Project Overview:  This project is about arrays and strings and object creation. 

Task 1 : Is about Arrays

File: `arrayManipulation.js`

I wrote a function called `processArray` in `arrayManipulation.js`. It takes a bunch of numbers and changes them up: -**Even numbers:** It squares them. -**Odd numbers:** It cubes them.


Task 2 :  Is about Strings
File: `arrayManipulation.js`
I added a function called `formatArrayStrings` to the same file. This one's a bit more interesting. It takes an array of strings and another array of numbers. It then changes the strings based on the numbers: -**Even number:** The corresponding string gets capitalized (all letters become uppercase). -**Odd number:** The string gets turned into lowercase. I also learned that it's a good idea to make a copy of the original strings before changing them, just in case I need them later.


Task 3: It creates User Profiles

File : `userInfo.js`

The last task was to create a new file (`userInfo.js`) with a function called `createUserProfiles`. This one takes the original and modified strings from Task 2 and turns them into user profiles. Each profile has: -`originalName`: The name before the makeover. -`modifiedName`: The new, fancy version of the name. -`id`: A unique number for each profile, starting from 1.
